# Think Python: Jupyter Notebook Edition

## About the Book

"Think Python" is a comprehensive introduction to programming using the Python language. It is designed for beginners and gradually introduces more complex topics such as recursion and object-oriented programming in a digestible manner. The book is widely used in universities and is effective for teaching programming fundamentals.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/worachat-dev/Think-Python-How2Think-Like-Computer-Scientist.git
    ```

    Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Install required libraries:**

    The code examples rely on several Python libraries. Install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
    ```

3. **Open a Jupyter Notebook:**

    Navigate to the project directory and launch a Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```bash
    cd Think-Python-How2Think-Like-Computer-Scientist
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open a web interface where you can browse and execute the Jupyter notebooks.
