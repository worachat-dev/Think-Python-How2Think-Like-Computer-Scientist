    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "The language feature most often associated with object-oriented programming is inheritance.\n",
    "Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing\n",
    "class. In this chapter I demonstrate inheritance using classes that represent playing\n",
    "cards, decks of cards, and poker hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t play poker, you can read about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker,\n",
    "but you don’t have to; I’ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.\n",
    "Code examples from this chapter are available from http://thinkpython2.com/code/Card.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.1 Card objects\n",
    "\n",
    "There are fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of\n",
    "thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in\n",
    "bridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on\n",
    "the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the attributes\n",
    "should be: rank and suit. It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be.\n",
    "One possibility is to use strings containing words like 'Spade' for suits and 'Queen' for\n",
    "ranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards\n",
    "to see which had a higher rank or suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to use integers to **encode** the ranks and suits. In this context, “encode”\n",
    "means that we are going to define a mapping between numbers and suits, or between\n",
    "numbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be\n",
    "“encryption”).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer codes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"width:40%; border-style:solid;\"> \n",
    "    <tr><td>Spades</td> <td>-----------></td> <td>3</td>  </tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Hearts</td> <td>-----------></td> <td>2</td>  </tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Diamonds</td> <td>----------></td> <td>1</td>  </tr>     \n",
    "    <tr><td>Clubs</td> <td>-----------></td> <td>0</td>  </tr> </table> \n",
    "\n",
    "This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to higher numbers, we\n",
    "can compare suits by comparing their codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corresponding\n",
    "integer, and for face cards:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"width:40%; border-style:solid;\"> \n",
    "    <tr><td>Jack</td> <td>-----------></td> <td>11</td>  </tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Queen</td> <td>-----------></td> <td>12</td>  </tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>King</td> <td>----------></td> <td>13</td>  </tr> </table> \n",
    "\n",
    "These mappings are not part of the Python\n",
    "program. They are part of the program design, but they don’t appear explicitly in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class definition for Card looks like this:"

    "\n",
    "So far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of a program, and object diagrams,\n",
    "which show the attributes of an object and their values. These diagrams represent\n",
    "a snapshot in the execution of a program, so they change as the program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too detailed. A class diagram is a more\n",
    "abstract representation of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual objects,\n",
    "it shows classes and the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several kinds of relationship between classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example,\n",
    "each Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to\n",
    "many Cards. This kind of relationship is called **HAS-A**, as in, “a Rectangle has a\n",
    "Point.”\n",
    "- One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called **IS-A**, as in, “a Hand\n",
    "is a kind of a Deck.”\n",
    "- One class might depend on another in the sense that objects in one class take objects\n",
    "in the second class as parameters, or use objects in the second class as part of a\n",
    "computation. This kind of relationship is called a **dependency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class diagram** is a graphical representation of these relationships. For example, Figure\n",
    "18.2 shows the relationships between Card, Deck and Hand.\n",
    "![fig18_2.gif](attachment:fig18_2.gif)\n",
    "The arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A relationship; in this case it indicates\n",
    "that Hand inherits from Deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard arrow head represents a HAS-A relationship; in this case a Deck has references\n",
    "to Card objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The star (\\*) near the arrow head is a **multiplicity**; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has.\n",
    "A multiplicity can be a simple number, like 52, a range, like 5..7 or a star, which indicates\n",
    "that a Deck can have any number of Cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no dependencies in this diagram. They would normally be shown with a dashed\n",
    "arrow. Or if there are a lot of dependencies, they are sometimes omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a list of Cards, but\n",
    "built-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.9 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance can make debugging difficult because when you invoke a method on an object,\n",
    "it might be hard to figure out which method will be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You would like it to\n",
    "work with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method\n",
    "like shuffle, you might get the one defined in Deck, but if any of the subclasses override\n",
    "this method, you’ll get that version instead. This behavior is usually a good thing, but it\n",
    "can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your program, the simplest\n",
    "solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods. If\n",
    "Deck.shuffle prints a message that says something like Running Deck.shuffle, then as\n",
    "the program runs it traces the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object and a method name\n",
