    "\n",
    "All of the exercises in the previous section have something in common; they can be solved\n",
    "with the search pattern we saw in Section 8.6. The simplest example is:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def has_no_e(word):\n",
    "    for letter in word:\n",
    "        if letter == 'e':\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    return True```\n",
    "The for loop traverses the characters in word. If we find the letter “e”, we can immediately\n",
    "return False; otherwise we have to go to the next letter. If we exit the loop normally, that\n",
    "means we didn’t find an “e”, so we return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could write this function more concisely using the in operator, but I started with this\n",
    "version because it demonstrates the logic of the search pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "avoids is a more general version of has_no_e but it has the same structure:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def avoids(word, forbidden):\n",
    "    for letter in word:\n",
    "        if letter in forbidden:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    return True```\n",
    "We can return False as soon as we find a forbidden letter; if we get to the end of the loop,\n",
    "we return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "uses_only is similar except that the sense of the condition is reversed:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def uses_only(word, available):\n",
    "    for letter in word:\n",
    "        if letter not in available:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    return True```\n",
    "Instead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list of available letters. If we find a letter in\n",
    "word that is not in available, we can return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "uses_all is similar except that we reverse the role of the word and the string of letters:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def uses_all(word, required):\n",
    "    for letter in required:\n",
    "        if letter not in word:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    return True```\n",
    "Instead of traversing the letters in word, the loop traverses the required letters. If any of the\n",
    "required letters do not appear in the word, we can return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would have recognized that\n",
    "uses_all was an instance of a previously solved problem, and you would have written:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def uses_all(word, required):\n",
    "    return uses_only(required, word)```\n",
    "This is an example of a program development plan called **reduction to a previously solved\n",
    "problem**, which means that you recognize the problem you are working on as an instance\n",
    "of a solved problem and apply an existing solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.4 Looping with indices\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote the functions in the previous section with for loops because I only needed the\n",
    "characters in the strings; I didn’t have to do anything with the indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For is_abecedarian we have to compare adjacent letters, which is a little tricky with a for\n",
    "loop:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def is_abecedarian(word):\n",
    "    previous = word[0]\n",
    "    for c in word:\n",
    "        if c < previous:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        previous = c\n",
    "    return True```\n",
    "An alternative is to use recursion:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def is_abecedarian(word):\n",
    "    if len(word) <= 1:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "    if word[0] > word[1]:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    return is_abecedarian(word[1:])```\n",
    "Another option is to use a while loop:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def is_abecedarian(word):\n",
    "    i = 0\n",
    "    while i < len(word)-1:\n",
    "        if word[i+1] < word[i]:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        i = i+1\n",
    "    return True```\n",
    "The loop starts at i=0 and ends when i=len(word)-1. Each time through the loop, it compares\n",
    "the ith character (which you can think of as the current character) to the i + 1th\n",
    "character (which you can think of as the next).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current one, then we have discovered\n",
    "a break in the abecedarian trend, and we return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the word passes the test. To\n",
    "convince yourself that the loop ends correctly, consider an example like 'flossy'. The\n",
    "length of the word is 6, so the last time the loop runs is when i is 4, which is the index of\n",
    "the second-to-last character. On the last iteration, it compares the second-to-last character\n",
    "to the last, which is what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a version of is_palindrome (see Exercise 6.3) that uses two indices; one starts at\n",
    "the beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def is_palindrome(word):\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "j = len(word)-1\n",
    "    while i<j:\n",
    "        if word[i] != word[j]:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        i = i+1\n",
    "        j = j-1\n",
    "    return True```\n",
    "Or we could reduce to a previously solved problem and write:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def is_palindrome(word):\n",
    "    return is_reverse(word, word)```\n",
    "Using is_reverse from Section 8.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.5 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing programs is hard. The functions in this chapter are relatively easy to test because\n",
    "you can check the results by hand. Even so, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible\n",
    "to choose a set of words that test for all possible errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking has_no_e as an example, there are two obvious cases to check: words that have an\n",
    "‘e’ should return False, and words that don’t should return True. You should have no\n",
    "trouble coming up with one of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases. Among the words that have an\n",
    "“e”, you should test words with an “e” at the beginning, the end, and somewhere in the\n",
    "middle. You should test long words, short words, and very short words, like the empty\n",
    "string. The empty string is an example of a **special case**, which is one of the non-obvious\n",
    "cases where errors often lurk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test your program with a word list\n",
    "like words.txt. By scanning the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:\n",
    "you might catch one kind of error (words that should not be included, but are) and not\n",
    "another (words that should be included, but aren’t).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to generate a good set of\n",
    "test cases, and even if you do, you can’t be sure your program is correct. According to a\n",
    "legendary computer scientist\n",
