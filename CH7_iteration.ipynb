    "\n",
    "To understand what an algorithm is, it might help to start with something that is not an\n",
    "algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized\n",
    "the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions. That kind of\n",
    "knowledge is not algorithmic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you were “lazy”, you might have learned a few tricks. For example, to find the\n",
    "product of n and 9, you can write n - 1 as the first digit and 10 - n as the second digit.\n",
    "This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That’s an\n",
    "algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrowing,\n",
    "and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that\n",
    "they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes where\n",
    "each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing algorithms is boring, but designing them is interesting, intellectually challenging,\n",
    "and a central part of computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are\n",
    "the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example.\n",
    "We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form\n",
    "of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.7 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.\n",
    "More code means more chances to make an error and more places for bugs to hide.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection”. For example, if there\n",
    "are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.\n",
    "Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for\n",
    "an intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a\n",
    "verifiable effect) and run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the first half of the program.\n",
    "If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search.\n",
    "After six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code,\n",
    "at least in theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always possible\n",
    "to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead,\n",
    "think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy\n",
    "to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that\n",
    "the bug is before or after the check.\n",
