The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and underscore are legal, but the first character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any arguments.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3.6 Flow of execution\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that a function is defined before its first use, you have to know the order statements run in, which is called the __flow of execution__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Usually statements are run one at atime, in order from top to bottom. With notebooks, however we can run cells in any order, although a well written notebook will have cells that can be run top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function don’t run until the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, runs the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to run the statements in another function. Then, while running that new function, the program might have to run yet another function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, when you read a program, you don’t always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of execution.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Parameters and arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call _math.sin_ you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: _math.pow_ takes two, the base and the exponent.\n",

    "### 3.11 Why functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There\n",
    "are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.12 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, *The Sign of Four*)\n",
    "\n",
    "For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a working program and make small modifications, debugging them as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Linux is an operating system that contains millions of lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield, “One of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.” (*The Linux Users’ Guide* Beta Version 1).\n",

    "### 3.13 Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "**function:** A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**function definition:** A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name, parameters, and the statements it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**function object:** A value created by a function definition. The name of the function is a variable that refers to a function object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**header:** The first line of a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**body:** The sequence of statements inside a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**parameter:** A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "**function call:** A statement that runs a function. It consists of the function name followed by an argument list in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**argument:** A value provided to a function when the function is called. This value is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**local variable:** A variable defined inside a function. A local variable can only be used inside its function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**return value:** The result of a function. If a function call is used as an expression, the return value is the value of the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**fruitful function:** A function that returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**void function:** A function that always returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "**None:** A special value returned by void functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**module:** A file that contains a collection of related functions and other definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**import statement:** A statement that reads a module file and creates a module object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**module object:** A value created by an import statement that provides access to the values defined in a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dot notation:** The syntax for calling a function in another module by specifying the module name followed by a dot (period) and the function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**composition:** Using an expression as part of a larger expression, or a statement as part of a larger statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**flow of execution:** The order statements run in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**stack diagram:** A graphical representation of a stack of functions, their variables, and the values they refer to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**frame:** A box in a stack diagram that represents a function call. It contains the local variables and parameters of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**traceback:** A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs.\n",
