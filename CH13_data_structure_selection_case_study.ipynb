    "\n",
    "For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word has to be “bee”,\n",
    "because the prefix only appears once in the text. The next prefix is “a bee”, so the next\n",
    "suffix might be “philosophically”, “be” or “due”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but you can do Markov analysis with\n",
    "any prefix length.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 13.8. Markov analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov analysis. The result should be\n",
    "a dictionary that maps from prefixes to a collection of possible suffixes. The collection might\n",
    "be a list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate choice. You can test your\n",
    "program with prefix length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy\n",
    "to try other lengths.<br><br>\n",
    "2. Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based on the Markov analysis.\n",
    "Here is an example from Emma with prefix length 2:<br>\n",
    ">He was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such\n",
    "a stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you were never meant for me?\" \"I\n",
    "cannot make speeches, Emma:\" he soon cut it all himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, The punctuation was left attached to the words. The result is almost syntactically\n",
    "correct, but not quite. Semantically, it almost makes sense, but not quite.<br><br>\n",
    "What happens if you increase the prefix length? Does the random text make more sense?\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up: if you combine text from\n",
    "two or more books, the random text you generate will blend the vocabulary and phrases from\n",
    "the sources in interesting ways.\n",

    "- How to represent the collection of possible suffixes.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the suffixes, one option is a list; another is a histogram (dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "How should you choose? The first step is to think about the operations you will need to\n",

    "from the beginning and add to the end. For example, if the current prefix is “Half a”, and\n",

    "\n",
    "Your first choice might be a list, since it is easy to add and remove elements, but we also\n",

    "suffix (or increasing the frequency of an existing one), and choosing a random suffix.\n",
    "Adding a new suffix is equally easy for the list implementation or the histogram. Choosing\n",
    "a random element from a list is easy; choosing from a histogram is harder to do efficiently\n",

    "\n",
    "The other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a histogram for the collection\n",

    "### 13.10 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug,\n",
    "there are five things to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading:** Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you\n",
    "meant to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running:** Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often if you\n",
    "display the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious,\n",
    "but sometimes you have to build scaffolding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ruminating:** Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, or semantic?\n",
    "What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the\n",
    "program? What kind of error could cause the problem you’re seeing? What did you\n",
    "change last, before the problem appeared?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rubberducking:** If you explain the problem to someone else, you sometimes find the\n",
    "answer before you finish asking the question. Often you don’t need the other\n",
    "person; you could just talk to a rubber duck. And that’s the origin of the wellknown\n",
    "strategy called rubber duck debugging. I am not making this up; see\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retreating:** At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes, until\n",
    "you get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then you can start\n",
    "rebuilding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget the others.\n",
    "Each activity comes with its own failure mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but\n",
    "not if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don’t understand what your\n",
    "program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in\n",
    "your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run\n",
    "experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call\n",
    "“random walk programming”, which is the process of making random changes until the\n",
    "program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have\n",
    "at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try\n",
    "to think of a test that would eliminate one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code\n",
    "you are trying to fix is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat,\n",
    "simplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t stand to delete a\n",
    "line of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another\n",
    "file before you start stripping it down. Then you can copy the pieces back one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If\n",
    "you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "**deterministic:** Pertaining to a program that does the same thing each time it runs, given\n",
    "the same inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pseudorandom:** Pertaining to a sequence of numbers that appears to be random, but is\n",
    "generated by a deterministic program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**default value:** The value given to an optional parameter if no argument is provided.\n",

    "**override:** To replace a default value with an argument.\n",

    "#### Exercise 13.9. \n",
    "The “rank” of a word is its position in a list of words sorted by frequency: the most\n",
    "common word has rank 1, the second most common has rank 2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipf’s law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies of words in natural languages\n",
    "(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law ). Specifically, it predicts that the frequency,\n",
    "f , of the word with rank r is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f = cr^{-s} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where s and c are parameters that depend on the language and the text. If you take the logarithm of\n",
    "both sides of this equation, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log{f} = \\log{c} - s \\log{r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you plot log f versus log r, you should get a straight line with slope -s and intercept log c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that reads a text from a file, counts word frequencies, and prints one line for each\n",
