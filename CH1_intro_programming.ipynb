    "#  The way of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this class is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, “The way of the program”.\n",
    "\n",
    "On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or\n",
    "playing a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>input:</b> Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>output:</b> Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>math:</b> Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>conditional execution:</b> Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>repetition:</b> Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these. So you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Running Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are viewing this notebook you are already in an environment to run Python. Another option in the Anaconda package is the Spyder IDE. You can also install Python and run it using the Python interpreter directly with command lines, but you will need to edit Python scripts in an seperate editor. It's a lot easier to use Jupyter Notebooks or Spyder IDE. The Spyder IDE provides some tools for debugging that aren't present in Jupyter Notebooks. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. IDEs are useful for debugging complex code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of Python, called Python 2 and Python 3. They are very similar, so if you learn one, it is easy to switch to the other. In fact, there are only a few differences you will encounter as a beginner. We will be using Python 3, but there will be some notes about Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks allow you to have your code in cells, so that you can execute one piece of code at a time. There are different types of cells in notebooks, this is a markdown cell, which allows some text formatting, but can't run code. A code cell is where you can run code, the next cell is a code cell. You can run a code cell by either clicking the <b>Run</b> button at the top of the notebook page or clicking the arrow beside the cell. You will have to put your mouse over the cell to see its arrow.\n",

    "\n",
    "The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be displayed; they don’t appear in the result.\n",

    "The parentheses indicate that print is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3.\n",

    "## 1.6 Formal and natural languages\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Natural languages</b> are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Formal languages</b> are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "   <b>Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Formal languages tend to have strict syntax rules that govern the structure of statements. For example, in mathematics the statement 3 + 3 = 6 has correct syntax, but 3+ = 3$6 does not. In chemistry H2O is a syntactically correct formula, but 2Zz is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with 3+ = 3$6 is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics. Similarly, 2Zz is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of syntax rule pertains to the way tokens are combined. The equation 3+ = 3 is illegal because even though + and = are legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t*kens in it. This sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out the structure (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called <b>parsing</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, structure, and syntax—there are some differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>ambiguity:</b> Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>redundancy:</b> In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>literalness:</b> Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny dropped”, there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone understood something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean\n",
    "exactly what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to formal languages. The difference between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Poetry:</b> Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Prose:</b> The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Programs:</b> The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal languages are more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.7 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers make mistakes. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called bugs and the process of tracking them down is called debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were people. When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate people (Reeves and Nass, <i>The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People\n",
    "and Places</i>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many activities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a section, like this one, with suggestions for debugging. Hope they help!\n",
