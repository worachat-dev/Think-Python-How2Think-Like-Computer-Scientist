    "### 4.4 Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function definition and then call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(t):\n",
    "    for i in range(4):\n",
    "        t.fd(100)\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside the function, t refers to the same turtle bob, so t.lt(90) has the same effect as bob.lt(90). In that case, why not call the parameter bob? The idea is that t can be any turtle, not just bob , so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to square:   \n",
    "```python\n",
    "alice = turtle.Turtle()\n",
    "square(alice)```\n",
    "Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called __encapsulation__. One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to add a _length_ parameter to _square_. Here is a solution:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(t, length):\n",
    "    for i in range(4):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(90)\n",
    "        \n",
    "square(bob, 100)```\n",
    "Adding a parameter to a function is called __generalization__ because it makes the function more general: in the previous version, the square is always the same size; in this version it can be any size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing squares, _polygon_ draws regular polygons with any number of sides. Here is a solution:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def polygon(t, n, length):\n",
    "    angle = 360 / n\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(angle)\n",
    "    \n",
    "polygon(bob, 7, 70)```\n",
    "This example draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python 2, the value of angle might be off because of integer division. A simple solution is to compute _angle = 360.0 / n_. Because the numerator is a floating-point number, the result is floating point.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function has more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. In that case it is often a good idea to include the names of the parameters in the argument list:\n",
    "```python polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)```\n",
    "These are called **keyword arguments** because they include the parameter names as “keywords” (not to be confused with Python keywords like _while_ and _def_).\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments and parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6 Interface design\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to write circle, which takes a radius, r, as a parameter. Here is a simple\n",
    "solution that uses polygon to draw a 50-sided polygon:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "def circle(t, r):\n",
    "    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r\n",
    "    n = 50\n",
    "    length = circumference / n\n",
    "    polygon(t, n, length)```\n",
    "The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radius r using the formula $2 \\pi r$. Since we use _math.pi_, we have to import _math_. By convention, _import_ statements are usually at the beginning of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "*n* is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle, so _length_ is the length of each segment. Thus, polygon draws a 50-sided polygon that approximates a circle with radius r.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this solution is that n is a constant, which means that for very big circles,\n",
    "the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small\n",
    "segments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking n as a parameter.\n",
    "This would give the user (whoever calls _circle_) more control, but the interface would be\n",
    "less clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __interface__ of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What\n",
    "does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it allows the\n",
    "caller to do what they want without dealing with unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, r belongs in the interface because it specifies the circle to be drawn. n is\n",
    "less appropriate because it pertains to the details of how the circle should be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of n depending\n",
    "on _circumference_:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def circle(t, r):\n",
    "    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r\n",
    "    n = int(circumference / 3) + 3\n",
    "    length = circumference / n\n",
    "    polygon(t, n, length)```\n",
    "Now the number of segments is an integer near _circumference_/3, so the length of each\n",
    "segment is approximately 3, which is small enough that the circles look good, but big\n",
    "enough to be efficient, and acceptable for any size circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding 3 to n guarantees that the polygon has at least 3 sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.7 Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "When I wrote circle, I was able to re-use _polygon_ because a many-sided polygon is a good\n",
    "approximation of a circle. But _arc_ is not as cooperative; we can’t use _polygon_ or _circle_ to\n",
    "draw an arc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative is to start with a copy of _polygon_ and transform it into _arc_. The result\n",
    "might look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def arc(t, r, angle):\n",
    "    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360\n",
    "    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1\n",
    "    step_length = arc_length / n\n",
    "    step_angle = angle / n\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(step_length)\n",
    "        t.lt(step_angle)```\n",
    "The second half of this function looks like _polygon_, but we can’t re-use _polygon_ without\n",
    "changing the interface. We could generalize _polygon_ to take an angle as a third argument,\n",
    "but then _polygon_ would no longer be an appropriate name! Instead, let’s call the more\n",
    "general function _polyline_:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def polyline(t, n, length, angle):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(angle)```\n",
    "Now we can rewrite _polygon_ and _arc_ to use _polyline_:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def polygon(t, n, length):\n",
    "    angle = 360.0 / n\n",
    "    polyline(t, n, length, angle)\n",
    "\n",
    "def arc(t, r, angle):\n",
    "    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360\n",
    "    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1\n",
    "    step_length = arc_length / n\n",
    "    step_angle = float(angle) / n\n",
    "    polyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)```\n",
    "Finally, we can rewrite _circle_ to use _arc_:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def circle(t, r):\n",
    "    arc(t, r, 360)```\n",
    "This process—rearranging a program to improve interfaces and facilitate code re-use—is\n",
    "called __refactoring__. In this case, we noticed that there was similar code in _arc_ and _polygon_,\n",
    "so we “factored it out” into polyline.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had planned ahead, we might have written _polyline_ first and avoided refactoring,\n",
    "but often you don’t know enough at the beginning of a project to design all the interfaces.\n",
    "Once you start coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a sign\n",
    "that you have learned something.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.8 A development plan\n",
    "\n",
    "A development plan is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case\n",
    "study is “encapsulation and generalization”. The steps of this process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you get the program working, identify a coherent piece of it, encapsulate the\n",
    "piece in a function and give it a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working\n",
    "code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you\n",
    "have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process has some drawbacks-—we will see alternatives later—-but it can be useful if\n",
    "you don’t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach\n",
    "lets you design as you go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.9 docstring\n",
    "A __docstring__ is a string at the beginning of a function that explains the interface (“doc” is\n",
    "short for “documentation”). Here is an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def polyline(t, n, length, angle):\n",
    "\"\"\"Draws n line segments with the given length and\n",
    "angle (in degrees) between them. t is a turtle.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(angle)```\n",
    "By convention, all docstrings are triple-quoted strings, also known as multiline strings\n",
    "because the triple quotes allow the string to span more than one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is terse, but it contains the essential information someone would need to use this function.\n",
    "It explains concisely what the function does (without getting into the details of how\n",
    "it does it). It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of the function and\n",
    "what type each parameter should be (if it is not obvious).\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface design. A well designed interface should be simple to explain; if you have a hard time explaining one of your functions, maybe the interface could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.10 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide\n",
    "certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, _polyline_ requires four arguments: _t_ has to be a Turtle; _n_ has to be an integer;\n",
    "_length_ should be a positive number; and _angle_ has to be a number, which is understood\n",
    "to be in degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "These requirements are called __preconditions__ because they are supposed to be true before\n",
    "the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are **postconditions**.\n",
    "Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line\n",
    "segments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly documented!)\n",
    "precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not\n",
    "the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the preconditions are satisfied and the postconditions are not, the bug is in the function.\n",
    "If your pre- and post- conditions are clear, they can help with debugging.\n",

    "2. The version of _arc_ in Section 4.7 is not very accurate because the linear approximation of the\n",
    "circle is always outside the true circle. As a result, the Turtle ends up a few pixels away from\n",
    "the correct destination. My solution shows a way to reduce the effect of this error. Read the\n",
    "code and see if it makes sense to you. If you draw a diagram, you might see how it works.\n",
