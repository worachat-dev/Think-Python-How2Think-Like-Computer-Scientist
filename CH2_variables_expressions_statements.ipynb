You can also change a cell into a markdown cell to enter text, this cell is a markdown cell. Notebooks function as a hybrid between scripts and interactive Python. If you place a single line of code in a cell it works like a command line, if you put multiple lines of code it functions like a script, with the advantage that you don't lose all the actions you have performed when it ends, so that you can string together multiple cells to create a program.\n",

    "In Jupyter notebooks, your code is automatically saved to a file or you can save manually to be safe. The top of the notebook will tell whether you have unsaved changes. Saving also creates a checkpoint that you can go back to. \n",

    "Another way to program in Python is an Integrated Development Environment or IDE. IDE's allow you to view a script and a command line interface in separate windows. They also allow you to view the contents of your variables and set break points in your code. IDEs are better at debugging code than notebooks, but they are don't offer the display capabilities of a notebook. We will be taking a look at the Spyder IDE later in class, but will mostly work in notebooks. Both Jupyter Notebooks and the Spyder IDE are part of the Anaconda Python package."

    "Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Syntax error:</b> “Syntax” refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is a <b>syntax error</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python displays an error message and quits, and you will not be able to run the program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Runtime error:</b> The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Semantic error:</b> The third type of error is “semantic”, which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run without generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.\n",
